# Troubleshooting CCR-Rust

## Connection Issues

**"Connection refused"**
- Check provider URL in config
- Verify API endpoint is accessible
- Check firewall rules

**SSL/TLS errors**
- Ensure system CA certificates are installed
- Try with `RUST_LOG=reqwest=debug` for details

## Rate Limiting

### How CCR-Rust handles 429s

- A `429 Too Many Requests` marks that tier as rate-limited and immediately moves the current request to the next tier.
- Remaining retries for the same tier are skipped once a 429 is seen.
- Backoff is exponential and uses `Retry-After` when the provider returns it.
- Tiers can also be skipped proactively when headers indicate exhausted quota (`x-ratelimit-remaining: 0` with future `x-ratelimit-reset`).
- A successful request or completed stream clears backoff state for that tier.

### Detect rate-limit pressure

```bash
# Per-tier 429s and backoffs
curl -s localhost:3456/metrics | grep -E 'ccr_rate_limit_hits_total|ccr_rate_limit_backoffs_total'

# Failure reasons, including rate_limited
curl -s localhost:3456/metrics | grep ccr_failures_total

# Current tier latencies/ordering signal
curl -s localhost:3456/v1/latencies
```

```bash
# Log-level detection
RUST_LOG=ccr_rust=debug,tower_http=debug ccr-rust start --config ~/.claude-code-router/config.json
```

Look for these log lines:
- `Rate limited on ...`
- `Rate limited, backing off`
- `Skipping tier: backoff in effect`
- `Skipping tier: quota exhausted`

### Handle sustained rate limits

1. Add at least one additional provider tier so failover has capacity.
2. Put frequently rate-limited providers lower in the route order.
3. Verify provider account quota/limits and request higher limits if needed.
4. Keep `tierRetries` for transient non-429 failures; 429 behavior is handled separately by the rate-limit tracker.

## SSE Failure Events (`/v1/responses`)

For streaming Responses requests, CCR-Rust preserves SSE transport on terminal upstream failures and emits `response.failed`.

**Example 1: upstream returned JSON error body**

```text
event: response.failed
data: {"type":"response.failed","response":{"id":"resp_failed","object":"response","status":"failed","error":{"message":"{\"error\":{\"message\":\"upstream failed\"}}"}}}
```

**Example 2: upstream returned plain text body**

```text
event: response.failed
data: {"type":"response.failed","response":{"id":"resp_failed","object":"response","status":"failed","error":{"message":"upstream gateway timeout"}}}
```

Client handling rule:
- Treat `event: response.failed` as terminal.
- Parse `response.error.message` for provider details.

## Format Translation

**Tool calls not working**
- Ensure transformer chain includes `anthropic-to-openai`
- Check provider supports function calling

**Missing system prompt**
- Anthropic `system` field is auto-converted to OpenAI format
- Verify it's not being filtered by provider

## Pseudo-SSE (`forceNonStreaming`) Issues

### Tool_use blocks silently dropped

**Symptom:** Claude CLI exits with code 1 and logs:
```
[ede_diagnostic] result_type=user last_content_type=n/a stop_reason=tool_use
```

All affected tasks show `num_turns=1`, `stop_reason=tool_use`, and no `assistant` message event in the output. The model never gets to use its tools.

**Cause:** When `forceNonStreaming: true` is enabled (the default for AlphaHENG), non-streaming JSON responses from backends are converted to SSE events via `emit_anthropic_sse_events()` in `streaming.rs`. If this function doesn't handle all `AnthropicContentBlock` variants — specifically `ToolUse` and `Thinking` — those blocks are silently dropped. Claude CLI receives `stop_reason: tool_use` but no actual tool content blocks, which it treats as an error.

**Detection:**
```bash
# Check captures for tool_use responses that succeeded at the proxy level
ls ~/.ccr-rust/captures/ | grep kimi

# In a capture, response_body will show valid tool_use blocks:
python3 -c "
import json
with open('~/.ccr-rust/captures/kimi_ccr-kimi_TIMESTAMP.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
resp = json.loads(data['response_body'])
print([c['type'] for c in resp['content']])  # Should show ['text', 'tool_use']
"

# But Claude CLI output shows no assistant message event:
# Events: [system/init, system/api_retry, result/error_during_execution]
# (no type=assistant event between init and result = blocks were dropped)
```

**Fix applied:** `emit_anthropic_sse_events()` now handles all three block types:
- `Text` → `content_block_start` + `text_delta`
- `ToolUse` → `content_block_start` (with id/name/empty input) + `input_json_delta` (with full JSON)
- `Thinking` → `content_block_start` + `thinking_delta` + `signature_delta`

**Verification:**
```bash
# Send a tool-calling request and verify tool_use appears in SSE output
curl -s -N http://127.0.0.1:3456/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "x-anthropic-model: kimi,kimi-k2.5" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k2.5",
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "stream": true,
    "tools": [{"name": "Read", "description": "Read a file", "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"file_path": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["file_path"]}}],
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read the file /tmp/test.txt"}]
  }'
# Should see: event: content_block_start with "type":"tool_use"
# Should see: event: content_block_delta with "type":"input_json_delta"
```

## Performance

**High latency**
- Check `/v1/latencies` for slow tiers
- EWMA will auto-reorder, but may take 3+ requests
- Consider adjusting tier order in config

## Requests Bypassing Tier Order

**Symptom**: Lower-priority tiers (e.g., OpenRouter) receive all traffic while higher-priority tiers (e.g., GLM, Minimax) are never hit.

**Cause**: Clients like Codex CLI and Claude Code cache the `model` field from successful responses. If a request once fell back to `openrouter,openrouter/aurora-alpha`, subsequent requests will include that exact model string, causing CCR-Rust to prioritize that tier.

**Detection**:
```bash
tail -500 /tmp/ccr-rust.log | grep -E "Direct routing|moved to front"
```

If you see lines like:
```
Direct routing: openrouter,openrouter/aurora-alpha moved to front
```

This confirms the client is requesting a specific tier.

**Solution**: Enable `ignoreDirect` in your config:

```json
{
  "Router": {
    "ignoreDirect": true
  }
}
```

This forces all requests to start from tier 0, regardless of what model the client specifies.

**Restart required** after changing config:
```bash
ccr-rust stop && ccr-rust start
```

## Debugging

```bash
# Enable debug logging
RUST_LOG=ccr_rust=debug,tower_http=debug ./ccr-rust

# Check metrics
curl localhost:3456/metrics | grep ccr_

# Test health
curl localhost:3456/health
```
